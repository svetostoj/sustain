      <p>A. GreenBizCheck's world-leading,  online, high impact annual certification program has been heavily researched  and comprises the latest European and Asian best practice standards. It covers  energy, water, waste and recycling, transportation and travel, and supply chain  sustainability. Clients complete an online assessment and receive a  comprehensive environmental report containing their score and practical,  high-impact actions to reduce their footprint. Depending on how many  eco-actions are implemented, clients reach Bronze (70% of total points score),  Silver (80%) or Gold (90%) GreenBizCheck certification.<br>
        At this point in time there is no  official certifier of the certifiers as corporate sustainability is such a new  industry. We have ensured that our standards are very rigorous and that our  certification thresholds are set at high, yet achievable, levels. Our three  tiered certification standard also allows you to progressively become more  sustainable. We are sure that our standards will meet prospective future  regulatory requirements. Our clients and partner list includes: British  Standards Institution (inventors of ISO9000 and ISO14000), Corporate Express,  Harvey Norman, NSW Government - Department of Premier and Cabinet,  Mediterranean Shipping Company, NRMA, Australasian Compliance Institute (ACI),  Australian Human Resources Institute (AHRI), Australian Information Industry  Association (AIIA), Australian Interactive Media Industry Association (AIMIA),  NSW Business Chamber, Chamber of Commerce and Industry QLD, CitySmart, Climate  Friendly, other industry associations and many SME's.</p>
      <h2>Environment Facts</h2>
	   <p class="STYLE2">Global Warming</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Climate change to date has had a relatively small impact on our       standard of living. But it will only take a CO2 induced 6°„C       rise in average global temperature to wipe out the human race. </li>
        <li>We are producing 30 billion tonnes of CO2 p.a. and       only 50% is absorbed by our fast disappearing forests and increasingly       polluted oceans. The rest is accumulating in our atmosphere and warming       the planet. </li>
      </ul>
     <p class="STYLE2">The Atmosphere</p>
      <p><em>Global atmospheric concentrations  of CO2 have increased markedly as a result of human activities since  1750 and now far exceed pre-industrial values over the past 650,000 years.</em> . </p>
   <p class="STYLE2">Water</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>97% of the planets water is undrinkable salt water, 2% is       trapped in ice caps and glaciers; only 0.003% of all the earths water is       available as fresh water in the form of surface water. </li>
        <li>The global bottled water market is growing at 12% per year       (2005: $35bn); most bottles are made from PET a petroleum based plastic       (of which only a small percentage is recycled). </li>
      </ul>
  <p class="STYLE2">Biosphere</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Around 30% of the worlds fish stocks have collapsed. </li>
        <li>Planet Earth could lose 50% of its species by 2050. </li>
        <li>Approximately 27,000 species disappear each year°≠°≠</li>
      </ul>
     <p class="STYLE2">Waste &amp; Recycling</p>
      <h4>Paper</h4>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Paper makes up to 70 per cent of office waste. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Landfill Waste &amp; Recycling</h4>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>We produce and use about 7 trillion plastic bags per year       (these bags last anything form 20 to 1,000 years). </li>
        <li>The Styrofoam cups used every year would circle the planet at       least five times; they are not biodegradable and are rarely recycled. </li>
        <li>Recycling an aluminium can uses only 5% of the energy required       to make a new one. Recycling glass uses 26% of the energy. Every tonne of       paper recycled saves almost 13 trees, 4,100 kilowatts of electricity and       more than 30,000 litres of water. </li>
        <li>Daily worldwide sales figures of biros exceed 14 million: A       plastic pen in landfill will still be there in 50,000 years. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cigarettes</h4>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Contain some 3,900 chemicals (many of which are dangerous to       humans and living organisms). Filters are designed to trap some of the       more dangerous by-products making the butt a poisonous pellet. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Little Known Facts</h4>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Standard plastic bags last for thousands of years in the       environment </li>
        <li>Glass bottles can take one million years to biodegrade </li>
        <li>A disposable nappy can take 300 million years to decompose       naturally </li>
        <li>A plastic bottle or ink cartridge can last indefinitely </li>
        <li>Mobile phones and iPods are made from metals that do not       biodegrade at all </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Home and Office</h4>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>An unplugged mobile phone charger wastes 95% of the energy used       doing nothing. </li>
        <li>Leaving the lights on, combined with computers left on standby,       can double a companys energy bill. Lights left on generate unnecessary       heat, requiring the air-conditioner to work overtime, using even more       electricity. </li>
        <li>An ordinary incandescent bulb converts most of the energy into       heat not light. An energy efficient bulb can use up to 80% less energy and       lasts about 8 times longer. Although it costs about 10 times more than an       ordinary $1 bulb it will save over $80 in electricity. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="STYLE2">Transportation &amp; Travel</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>If you commute for 2 hours every day, in 40 years you will have       spent 2.3 years commuting. </li>
        <li>The aviation industry generates 2% of total greenhouse gas       emissions. Boeing alone is expected to deliver more than 27,000 aircraft       over the next 20 years (doubling the existing worldwide fleet). </li>
