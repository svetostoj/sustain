              <p>Renewable Energy  Certificates or RECs were introduced by the Australian Federal Government as an  incentive to assist the switch to renewable energy sources as part of its  policies to ensure Australia  meets its international commitments in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
                It introduced the Renewable  Energy (Electricity) Act 2000, supported by the Renewable Energy (Electricity)  Regulations in 2001, to increase renewable electricity generation from  Australia's renewable energy sources by encouraging the generation of an  additional 9,500 GWh of renewable energy per year by 2010.&nbsp; This has had a  substantial impact on the water heating industry<br>
  <strong>The thermal storage water  heater enables to:</strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>A- Protect the Environment</strong><br>
  <br>
                It does not produce any carbon dioxide and it naturally uses an environmental  -friendly source of energy. Several governments are now helping this activity  by offering tax advantages because they worry about the consequences of all the  climate changes.<br>
  <strong>B- Save Money</strong><br>
  <br>
                Using the sun which is for free, with a thermal storage water heater for a  reasonable price seems to be the best solution for easily reducing expenses. On  top of that the sun is a renewable energy, so the device will not lack any  energy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>C- Create a Long-term Relationship</strong><br>
  <br>
                The fact that a thermal storage water heater has a long lifespan combined to  the low need of maintenance induce a long use of the device without bothering  with useless worries.</p>
              <p>&#8226;  Sustainability-Z through Green  Professionals has secured access to quality environmental products and services  from Australia  leading manufacturers <br>
                &#8226;  In the first phase of the program,  products available include:<br>
